# nodemailer-any-promise

This is a fork of [nodemailer](https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer) (v2.6.4) with [any-promise](https://github.com/kevinbeaty/any-promise) support. No other feature is added or removed.

The original nodemailer only supports native promise and there will be no plan for other 3rd-part promise implementations ([#561](https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer/issues/516)). But, with the help of any-promise, now you can register your favorite promise library. For more detail on promise registration, see [any-promise documentation](https://github.com/kevinbeaty/any-promise#usage-with-registration).
